An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

Qualities of a good algorithm:
==============================
Input and output should be defined precisely.
Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
